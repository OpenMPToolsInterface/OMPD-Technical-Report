\section{Display Control Variables}
Using the \verb|ompd_get_display_control_vars| function,
the debugger can extract a NULL-terminated vector of strings
of name/value pairs of control variables whose settings are
(a) user controllable, and
(b) important to the operation or performance of an OpenMP runtime system.
The control variables exposed through this interface will include all
of the OMP environment variables,
settings that may come from vendor or platform-specific
environment variables (e.g., the IBM XL compiler has an environment
variable that controls spinning vs. blocking behavior),
and other settings that affect the operation or functioning
of an OpenMP runtime system
(e.g., {\tt numactl} settings that cause threads to be bound to cores).

\begin{quote}
\begin{lstlisting}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_display_control_vars (
  ompd_address_space_handle_t   *handle,                            /* IN */
  const char * const *          *control_var_values                /* OUT */
);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{quote}
\labeldef{get-display-control-vars:def}
The format of the strings is:

\centerline{\texttt{name=a string}}
\medskip
The debugger must not modify the vector or strings (\textit{i.e.},
they are both \texttt{const}).
The strings are NULL terminated.
The vector is NULL terminated.

After returning from the call, the vector and strings are `owned'
by the debugger.
Providing the termination constraints are satisfied,
the OMPD implementation is free to use static or dynamic
memory for the vector and/or the strings, and to arrange
them in memory as it pleases.
If dynamic memory is used, then the OMPD implementation
must use the allocate callback it received in the call to
\refdef{\texttt{ompd\_initialize}}{initialize:def}.
As the debugger cannot make any assumptions about how the
memory used for the vector and strings, it cannot
release the display control variables directly when they
are no longer needed, and instead it must use the
\texttt{ompd\_release\_display\_control\_vars} function:
\begin{quote}
\begin{lstlisting}
ompd_rc_t ompd_release_display_control_vars (
  const char * const *           control_var_values                 /* IN */
);
\end{lstlisting}
