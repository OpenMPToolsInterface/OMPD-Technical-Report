\section{Thread and Signal Safety}

The OMPD implementation does not need to be reentrant. It is the responsibility 
of the debugger to ensure that only one thread enters the OMPD DLL at a time.

The OMPD implementation must not install signal handlers or otherwise
interfere with the debugger's signal configuration.
